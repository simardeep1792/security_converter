# BASE STARTER FOR RUST-GRAPHQL-POSTGRES API (Security clearance converter)

This app is an proof of concept for GraphQL API middeware designed to provide an auditable trail of security classification conversions from any NATO nation to another, using the NATO standard as a Rosetta Stone.

- [ ] A data model for security classifications
- [ ] A model for tagging documents or data packages with unique IDs (blockchain implementation?)
- [ ] A return function that accepts a data object from any nation with their security classifcation and a target ally nation that returns a validated UUID, equivalent classification response and an auditable log of the transaction
- [ ] A model for community of interest and management tools to allow the creation of specialized groups for data and information access
- [ ] A Rust-based Web server designed for simplicity and speed

It also includes :

- [x] User models
- [x] Automated Admin Generation
- [x] Authentication and sign-in

## Dependencies

- Diesel-cli

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Create `.env` file with the following environmental variables:
  - DATABASE_URL=postgres://christopherallison:12345@localhost/classification_transformer?sslmode=disable
  - SECRET_KEY=32CHARSECRETKEY
  - PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY=32CHARSECRETKEY
  - JWT_SECRET_KEY=32CHARSECRETKEY
  - ADMIN_EMAIL=some_admin@email.com 
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD=ADMINPASSWORD
  - ADMIN_NAME="Admin Name"
- Change APP_NAME const in lib.rs to your app
- `diesel migration run`
- `cargo run`

## Dan's notes

### Running on MacOS

```bash
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres # if not already installed

# MacOS only clean up when done
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq

cargo clean

docker compose down; sleep 2; docker compose up -d db; sleep 10; diesel migration run
docker compose exec -it db psql -U christopherallison -W security_classification_converter
docker compose logs -f

time docker compose build people-data-api
docker images | grep epi
docker compose up
```

### WiP/TODO

- [x] Working: Dockerfile.simple again: worked (arm64:4.25GB)
- [x] Working: Dockerfile.slim finally working with base rust-image (arm64:1.98GB)
- [x] Working: Dockerfile.slim try debian:buster (arm64:444MB)
- [x] Working: Dockerfile.slim try debian:buster-slim : (arm64:392MB amd64:447MB )
- [x] Try again on codespaces (amd64)
  - [x] Rename Dockerfile.slim to Dockerfile.slim
- [x] Docker as non root user (rusty)

- [ ] Can I just copy src and Cargo.(toml|lock) into the image?
  - [ ] If so, Fix Dockerfile.simple as well
  - [ ] If so, remove the .dockerignore file
- [ ] Accelerate build with rust crate cache?
- [ ] Re-validate all dependencies in Dockerfile.slim
- [ ] alpine base image (musl)
  - [ ] [LogRocket Blog article](https://blog.logrocket.com/packaging-a-rust-web-service-using-docker/)
    - [ ] [Associated Repo](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-docker-web/blob/main/debian/Dockerfile)
  - [ ] Working: Dockerfile.alpine (arm64: 1.98GB)
  - [ ] Working: Dockerfile.alpine (arm64: 1.98GB)
- [x] http response type for index.html Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
- [x] replace openssl with libssl-dev in Dockerfile.simple
- [ ] Add e2e tests
- [x] progress indication with logging function
- [ ] Where shall we run diesel migrations?
  - Can use docker-compose to wait for db startup, and run migrations to completion
  - Create a diesel container, with migrations folders mounted, and run migrations

### Container image sizes

You can control the image you build by selecting the Dockerfile.XX in the docker-compose.yml file.
| Image              | arm64  | amd64                    | description                                |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| rust:1.68          | 4.25GB |                          | single stage (Dockerfile.simple)           |
| rust:1.68          | 1.98GB |                          | multi-stage                                |
| debian:buster      | 444MB  |                          | multi-stage                                |
| debian:buster-slim | 392MB  | 447MB (15 minutes build) | multi-stage (Dockerfile.slim)              |
| alpine:3.14        |        |                          | multi-stage musl based (Dockerfile.alpine) |

### Caching the build

To enable the caching of the compiling of the rust dependencies, you can modify the start of the Dockerfile.slim to add this:

```dockerfile
SNIPPET
```

| Image             | first | subsequent with only code change | description  |
|-------------------|-------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Dockerfile.simple | 238s  |                                  | single stage |
| Dockerfile.slim   | 216s  |                                  | multi-stage  |
| Dockerfile.fast   |       |                                  | multi-stage  |
